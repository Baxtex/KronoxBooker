# KronoxBooker
An application for automatic room booking on Kronox for Mah.
This solution contains two projects, one Console application and one Windows form(GUI). With the help of the GUI the user can use the
Windows Task Scheduler to schedule the console application to run at midnight. The Console application tries to login to https://schema.mah.se/start.jsp
and book a room for the user automaticly.

To use the application you have two options, either compile the two applications yourself or download the already compiled version. In both cases the runnable files have to be placed in your documents folder with the following folders:
C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Kronox Bot\files. If you download the compiled version, place it in your Documents folder like the example above.
